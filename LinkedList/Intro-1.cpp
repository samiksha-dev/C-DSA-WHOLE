// Linked list is a linear data structure which is a collection of nodes
// nodes- represent data and address of next node

// Why Linked list is needed
// since arrays size cant be changed at the run time for eg. you created an array of size 5 now at run time i want to be 100 this is not possibe
// you might think we can use vector which is dynamic since if vectors size was 5 but now we want to insert more elements
// it will increase its size and become 10 but since we just wanted to insert 1 element the left spaces will be wasted
// but in this way vector wil create a new storage and will copy the elements which is not an optimal case

// therefore here comes linked list
// Advantages-Linked list is a dynamic Data structure which can grow or shrink at runtime
// no memory waste unlike vector
// Insertion and deletion is very easy since no shifting is required like array
// since it is dynamic it will obviously be stored in heap

// //TYPES OF LINKED LIST
// -->Singly Linked List
// -->Doubly Linked List
// -->Circular Linked List
