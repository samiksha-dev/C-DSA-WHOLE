#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// if we want to find a^b
// this can be found by two ways
//(a^(b/2)^2) if b is even
// or (a^(b/2)^2)*a if b is odd

// eg. 2^10=(2^5)^2
// eg.2 2^11=(2^5)^2*2
// This is called Fast Exponential whose complexity is O(logn)
// whereas if we would have find power by normal method it would be o(n)

// QUESTION-we have x,m,n we need to find (x^n)%m

// if we want to divide by 2 then pls do b>>1 means right shift by 1 means divide by 2
